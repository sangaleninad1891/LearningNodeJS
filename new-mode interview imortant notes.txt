DRUPAL INTERVIEW
Web Performance Optimization in Drupal:
* Advanced caching-
* Install Entity Cache module (content, users, taxonomy terms and there fileds are cached)
* Install Advanced CSS/JS Aggregation
* Limit the number of times cron is run (The best solution in terms of performance is to disable this and set cron on the server so that it is run in the background)

* Core caching and aggregation-
* Turn on core page caching
* Turn on core block caching
* Enable built in CSS and JS aggregation
* Enable Views caching (result is not real time, cache is set to 10 min then same content will be displayed for next 10 min even if the content is changed)
* Enable Views Content Cache (it monitors content that the view is returning and clear the cache if content is changed)
* Enable Views block cache
* Enable Views Litepager module (open view and set pager to lite pager)
* Enable Boost module (turns all drupal pages to flat HTML files and store them in cache folder. good for smaller sites. Boost module works for anonymous users)
* Uninstall the Statistics module (gives same result as google analytics and makes so many server requests and DB wirtes per page load)
* Disable PHP Filter (allows to add and store php code in text format which causes security and performance problem)
* Disable Update Manager module (which always checks for updates)
* Limit the number of modules in use and Disable and uninstall unused modules
* Resize images (use image resize filter module)

CRM integration
* CRM core module gives a way to create your own CRM in Drupal
o You can expect to find the following basic features within CRM Core modules:
o Tracks contacts, relationships and activities.
o Contacts, relationships and activities are all fieldable entities, meaning you can add as many custom fields as you want.
o The user synchronization module allows administrators to tie contacts to user accounts.
o The match module allows administrators to define rules for how duplicates are located in the system, and provides a flexible framework for building customized identification schemes.
o The report module provides a centralized location for storing reports related to contacts.
o A variety of bulk operations for merging contacts, putting people into households, sending messages via email, and the like.
* Use RedHen module for SalesForce. Redhen needs customization and configuration as per requirements.
